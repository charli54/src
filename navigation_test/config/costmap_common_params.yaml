#The "obstacle_range" parameter determines the maximum range sensor reading that will result in an obstacle being put into the costmap.
obstacle_range: 2.5
#he "raytrace_range" parameter determines the range to which we will raytrace freespace given a sensor reading. 
#Setting it to 3.0 meters as we have above means that the robot will attempt to clear out space in front of 
#it up to 3.0 meters away given a sensor reading.
